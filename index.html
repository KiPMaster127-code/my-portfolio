    <h2>Hello, my name is Misha Azaranka</h2>

    <p>I’ve always had a deep passion for computers and technology. Ever since my parents brought home our first computer, I was instantly curious about how it worked. 
      I remember one day, after a power outage, the computer wouldn’t turn on. My parents assumed it was permanently broken — but I decided to unplug the power cord and plug it back in. To everyone’s surprise, 
      the system powered up, and the classic Windows 98 startup music filled the room. It felt like I had brought the machine back to life, and that moment sparked something in me.</p>
    
    <p>I’m also passionate about music. In my free time, I love picking up my acoustic guitar and practicing new songs I discover on YouTube. It’s a creative outlet that balances my technical side and keeps me inspired.</p>

    <h2>I love spending my weekends diving into video games — some of my favorites:</h2>

        <li>Elder Scrolls</li>
        <li>Halo Mater Chief Collection</li>
        <li>Spider Man by Insomniac Games</li>
        <li>Phasmophobia</li>
