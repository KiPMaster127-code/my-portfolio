    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>

    <h2>Hello, my name is Misha Azaranka</h2>

    <p>I have a great passion in computers in technologies. Ever since my parents brought out first computer at home, 
      I was curious about our new device. One day our computer broke down after a power outage and my parents thought the computer was permanetely broken, 
      I unplugged a power cord and replugged the system and magically it has powered on the classical Windows 98 theme music, bringing the computer back to life.</p>
    
    <p>I am passionate also about music, on my free time. I love grabbing my acoustic guitar and practive some new songs I find on YouTube</p>

    <h2>I like to play video games on the weekends that include:</h2>

        <li>Elder Scrolls</li>
        <li>Halo Mater Chief Collection</li>
        <li>Spider Man by Insomniac Games</li>
